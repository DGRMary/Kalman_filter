# Kalman_filter
During my first year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled 'Estimation, filtering and system identificatio'. One of the main argument of this course was the design of a Kalman filter, using MATLAB.
In this partcular problem I design the:
- Steady state Kalman predictor in predictor-corrector form.
- Dynamic Kalman filter in standard form. 
In this repository you will find:
- The trace/ report "Report_A(2).pdf"
- The script "es2.m"
- The data "data2a(5).mat"
